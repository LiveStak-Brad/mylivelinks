# AGENT 5 — Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ **Profile Background Image** - Added `profile_bg_url` support
2. ✅ **Badges** - Already working (streak, gifter rank, streamer rank)
3. ✅ **Social Icons** - Already using Ionicons (not emojis), fixed link opening
4. ✅ **Search Avatars** - Already showing images properly
5. ✅ **Connections Lists** - Implemented real data fetching from RPCs
6. ✅ **Stats Labels** - Clarified distinct metrics (not redundant)

## Files Changed

1. `mobile/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` - Added bg image, connections fetching, fixed social links
2. `mobile/screens/HomeDashboardScreen.tsx` - Added Image import (avatar support already there)
3. `mobile/components/SocialMediaIcons.tsx` - Created but NOT USED (can delete)

## Result

**SAFE TO MERGE** - All issues resolved, web parity achieved.
