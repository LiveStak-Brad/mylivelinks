✖ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
Expected package @expo/config-plugins@^7.8.0
Found invalid:
  @expo/config-plugins@7.2.5
  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/config-plugins)
Expected package @expo/prebuild-config@^6.7.0
Found invalid:

  (for more info, run: npm why @expo/prebuild-config)
Advice:
Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.
✖ Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.json, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: scheme, orientation, icon, userInterfaceStyle, splash, ios, android, plugins, androidStatusBar. 
Advice:
Add '/ios' to your .easignore file if you intend to use CNG / Prebuild. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/prebuild/#usage-with-eas-build
✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  @react-native-async-storage/async-storage@1.24.0 - expected version: 1.21.0
  @react-native-community/slider@4.5.7 - expected version: 4.4.2
  expo-camera@14.0.6 - expected version: ~14.1.3
  expo-splash-screen@0.20.5 - expected version: ~0.26.5
  react-native-webview@13.16.0 - expected version: 13.6.4
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.

Advice:
Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
