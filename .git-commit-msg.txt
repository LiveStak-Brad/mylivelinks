fix: prevent viewer joins from causing battle grid re-renders

CRITICAL: When a viewer joined a battle room, ALL participants screens
were refreshing/flickering even though the grid didn't change.

Root cause:
1. Viewer joins LiveKit room
2. ParticipantConnected event fires
3. updateParticipants() is called
4. Loops through all participants, correctly skips viewer
5. Creates SAME gridParticipants array as before
6. BUT calls setParticipants(gridParticipants) with NEW array reference
7. React sees new array reference and triggers re-render on ALL screens
8. Result: Every host and viewer screen refreshes unnecessarily

Solution:
Add comparison logic in setParticipants to only update state if the
participant list actually changed:
- Compare participant count
- Compare participant IDs
- Compare video/audio track references
- If nothing changed, return previous array to prevent re-render

Also removed deprecated onRefreshSession prop from SoloStreamViewer.

Result:
- Viewer joins -> no re-render (unless they're actually a participant)
- Tracks change -> re-render only affected participant
- Participant joins/leaves -> re-render entire grid
- NO MORE SCREEN FLASHING when viewers join
