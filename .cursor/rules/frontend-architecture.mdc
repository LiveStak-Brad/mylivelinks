## Core Component Architecture

The frontend is organized around several key business domains:

1. Gifter Tier System (85/100)
- Centralized state management for gifter progression
- Badge component hierarchy reflecting 10 unique tiers
- Diamond tier infinite progression system
- Gifter profile customization based on tier level
Paths: apps/mobile/screens/GifterLevels/*, apps/mobile/components/GifterBadge/*

2. Live Content System (80/100)
- Split view architecture for battle mode streaming
- Viewer count aggregation components 
- Real-time gift animation system
- Platform-aware video layout engine
Paths: apps/mobile/screens/Live/*, apps/mobile/components/LiveStream/*

3. Dating Feature System (75/100)
- Profile card component architecture
- Two-way matching state management
- Preference-based filtering components
- Privacy-aware profile display system
Paths: apps/mobile/screens/Dating/*, apps/mobile/components/ProfileCard/*

4. Multi-Currency Wallet (70/100)
- Unified wallet interface for coins/diamonds
- Transaction history virtualization
- Currency conversion components
- Purchase flow state machine
Paths: apps/mobile/screens/Wallet/*, apps/mobile/components/Transaction/*

## State Management

1. Profile Context (75/100)
- Centralized profile type management
- Feature flag system by profile type
- Module visibility control
- Cross-platform feature parity handling
Paths: apps/mobile/state/ProfileContext.tsx

2. Battle Context (70/100)
- Real-time battle state synchronization
- Team scoring management
- Gift contribution tracking
- Layout mode coordination
Paths: apps/mobile/state/BattleContext.tsx

## UI Patterns

1. Feed Systems (65/100)
- Vertical scroll content feeds
- Mode-based content filtering
- Interaction tracking system
- Delayed view counting
Paths: apps/mobile/components/Feed/*

2. Gift Animation System (60/100)
- Queue-based gift display
- Multi-tier animation complexity
- Performance-aware rendering
Paths: apps/mobile/components/GiftAnimation/*
